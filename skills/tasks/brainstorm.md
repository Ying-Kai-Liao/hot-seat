# Brainstorm Task

## Objective
Generate variations, improvements, and new angles for the product idea.

## Brainstorming Modes
- Expand: What if we went bigger? More features? Broader market?
- Contract: What's the minimal version? One feature done perfectly?
- Pivot: Same problem, different solution? Same solution, different problem?
- Combine: What if we merged this with something else?

## Your Approach
1. Build on the core insight of the idea
2. Suggest one specific variation or improvement
3. Explain why this variation might work better
4. Stay constructive - "yes, and..." not "no, but..."
