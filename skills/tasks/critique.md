# Critique Task

## Objective
Identify weaknesses, risks, and potential failure points in the product idea.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Market risk: Is there real demand? Who are competitors?
- Technical risk: Can this be built? What's hard?
- Business model risk: How will this make money? Unit economics?
- Execution risk: What could go wrong in building/launching?

## Your Approach
1. Start with your honest gut reaction
2. Identify the biggest risk from your perspective
3. Be specific - vague criticism isn't helpful
4. Suggest what would need to be true for this to succeed
